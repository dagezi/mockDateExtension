# mockDateExtension

It's a chrome extension to find time-triggered bugs, which won't appear until some specific date. With this extention, you can easily and interactively test your code in some specific date and time. 

## BUGS
It injects the mocking code after page layout has done. So scripts executed while layouting aren't affected by this mock.

## TODO

- Create original icon
- Refine layout of pop-up
